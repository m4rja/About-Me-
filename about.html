    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>I come from the Philippines and I've been living in Washington for around 18 years now! I come south from Seattle and was raised around the Lakewood/Tacoma area and I came up to Seattle to challenge myself into living on my own.  </p>
    
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of classes, I love to draw, bake, play games, and go to concerts! I've seen plenty of artists and I definitely plan on seeing more! I've seen artists like Lady Gaga, Tyler, the Creator, Kali Uchis, ENHYPEN, ATEEZ, and my most recent was TWICE!  </p>

  <p>These are my <strong>favorite</strong> K-Pop Groups:
   <ul>
    <li>BTS</li>
    <li>TWICE</li>
    <li>ENHYPEN</li>
    <li>ATEEZ</li>
    <li>LE SSERAFIM</li>
   </ul>
