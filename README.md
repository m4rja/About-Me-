# About Me! 

Hey! My name is Maria Atayan and this is my little introduction about myself! 

## Academics 

I am currently a second year who is trying to major in LSJ and hopefully Political Science with a chance of a possible English minor as well. I enrolled in **ENGL396: Software Documentation** for English credits, but I am also interested in the comp sci department as someone who isn't in that major or plan to have a career in that field. After graduating, I plan on using my degree to do something with law and potentially go into law school in the future. 

Some of my favorite classes in UW include: 

- [Contemporary Issues In Comparative Legal Institutions](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/LSJ%20380)
- [Immigration, Citizenship, and Rights](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/LSJ%20329)
- [Disability and Socieity](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/LSJ%20332)

- ## Programming Background

- I am very new to programming and have no experience whatsoever in this field. Here is a table about my experiences:

| Language | Experience |
|---------:|------------|
| Python   | None!  |
|  HTML    | None!   |
|  SQL     | None!    |


## Words of Wisdom 

I don't exactly have a favorite quote or lyric that encoruages me, but just thinking of what my parents did to sacrifice coming here to give me a better life just motivates me to continue on. :)
